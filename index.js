/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?

- counter 1 is a function nested inside function counterMaker, while counter2 is not (in this case, counter1 is called calll back function). In order to invoke counter1, we have to invoke function counterMaker, while we can dierctly invoke counter2

  
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?

  - It allows us to put functions together
  - A closure gives us access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
  
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  

     - When we want to ensure the privacy of data, counter1 is preferred. The basic priciple is that the children function (counter) can reach out to the parent function's scope (counterMaker) to grab a value, while it can't be the opposite.

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 2: inning() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below

Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5
}

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 4: getInningScore() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the getInningScore() function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a callback function - you will pass in the inning function from task 2 as your argument 
  2. Return an object with a score for home and a score for away that populates from invoking the inning callback function */

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 5: scoreboard() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 3: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 4: Away 2 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 2 - Home 0",

  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 2",

  "Final Score: Away 11 - Home 12"

  TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return

  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 2",
